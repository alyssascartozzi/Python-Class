# Python-Class

# Creation of a Python Environment 
To create this environment, all I did was open my personal terminal, created the environment, downloaded numpy, and then exported the environment into a .yml file

Here is the code I used:  
```
conda create -n envs 
conda activate envs 
conda install numpy 
conda env export > pythonclass_AS.yml 
conda deactivate 
```
